Discuss:

The concentration against time graphs show that each species alternates out of phase to keep the total concentration the same. 
The products formed in the reation is zero to begin with.
Over time the concentrations level off or stablize as the reaction stops and all the product is formed.

The concentration against concentration graphs show how each species/products vary with respect to each other. 
Again, the concentration of both starts from zero. 
The plots are symetetrical implying the inverse altination between each species in concentration.
